# Uncommon VHDL Bug: Incorrect Signal Initialization

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic bug in VHDL related to the initialization of internal signals.  Incorrectly initializing signals can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues.

The `bug.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.vhdl` file provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The `internal_data` signal in the original code is initialized to `x"00"`, which is a valid initialization but might not reflect the intended initial state.  Depending on the context, this might lead to incorrect outputs during the first clock cycle or introduce race conditions.  A more appropriate initialization may be required to ensure a well-defined initial state.

## Solution

The solution initializes `internal_data` to "00000000", a clearly defined value, ensuring predictable behavior. This initialization provides a clear default state before any data is received.
